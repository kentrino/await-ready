            Review this PR and provide inline feedback using the GitHub review system.

            Steps:
            1. Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a pending review
            2. Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the changes and line numbers
            3. Use `mcp__github__add_comment_to_pending_review` for each piece of feedback
            4. Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" to publish

            Focus on:
            - Correctness and potential bugs
            - Security concerns
            - Breaking changes
            - Performance considerations
            - Unnecessary state
            - Inconsistent code
            - Unnecessary complexity

            Do not comment on style or formatting — those are handled by automated tools (oxlint, oxfmt).
            Only leave comments where corrections are necessary. No compliments.
            Submit as "COMMENT" type so the review does not block the PR.
