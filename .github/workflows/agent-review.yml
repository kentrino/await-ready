            Review this PR and provide inline feedback using the GitHub review system.
            DO NOT repeat feedback that was already left in prior runs.

            Steps:
            0. **Load existing review feedback (dedupe baseline)**:
               - Call `mcp__github__get_pull_request_review_comments` to fetch existing inline review comments.
               - Treat any comment containing `<!-- agent-review:finding:` as already reviewed.
               - Extract all finding IDs into a set `alreadyReviewedFindingIds`.
               - Fallback key per comment: `{path}:{line}:{first_sentence_normalized}`.

            1. **Start a review**: Use `mcp__github__create_pending_pull_request_review` to begin a pending review

            2. **Get diff**: Use `mcp__github__get_pull_request_diff` to understand the changes and line numbers

            3. **Add inline comments (only NEW findings)**:
               - For each new issue, generate a stable finding ID:
                 `FINDING_ID = "<path>|<symbol_or_function>|<category>|<short_slug>"`
               - If `FINDING_ID` is in `alreadyReviewedFindingIds`, SKIP.
               - Otherwise, add the comment with the ID as an HTML marker on the first line:
                 `<!-- agent-review:finding:FINDING_ID -->`
               - If an issue was already pointed out but is still unfixed, do NOT re-comment.

            4. **Submit the review**: Use `mcp__github__submit_pending_pull_request_review` with event type "COMMENT" to publish

            Focus on:
            - Correctness and potential bugs
            - Security concerns
            - Breaking changes
            - Performance considerations
            - Unnecessary state
            - Inconsistent code
            - Unnecessary complexity

            Do not comment on style or formatting — those are handled by automated tools (oxlint, oxfmt).
            Only leave comments where corrections are necessary. No compliments.
            Submit as "COMMENT" type so the review does not block the PR.
